#
# NETWORKING CONFIGURATION
#
# This module defines the networking stack for the system, prioritizing
# stability and reliability for a seamless daily-driver experience.
#
# ### Why NetworkManager + wpa_supplicant + systemd-resolved?
#
# After extensive testing, the combination of NetworkManager, wpa_supplicant,
# and systemd-resolved has proven to be the most robust and dependable solution for
# managing network connections on this system. This stack excels in scenarios
# where other configurations, particularly those involving `iwd` and `connman`,
# have shown instability.
#
# Key advantages of this setup include:
#
# - **Reliable Suspend/Hibernate Recovery:** Unlike `iwd`, which can struggle
#   to automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi networks after the system wakes from
#   sleep or hibernation, the `wpa_supplicant` backend for NetworkManager
#   handles these transitions flawlessly. This ensures that the network is
#   immediately available without manual intervention.
#
# - **Stable Tethering:** Mobile tethering, a frequent use case, is
#   significantly more reliable with NetworkManager. It gracefully handles
#   connection and disconnection cycles, which can be problematic with `connman`.
#
# - **Secure and Simple DNS:** `systemd-resolved` is used as the DNS backend to
#   provide simple, reliable, and secure DNS resolution with caching.
#   It is configured to use DNS-over-TLS (DoT) by default, encrypting all DNS
#   queries and enhancing privacy. While `unbound` offers more powerful
#   features, `systemd-resolved` provides a "just works" experience that is
#   perfectly integrated into the OS.
#
# ### The `iwd`, `connman`, and `unbound` Stack: A Note on Instability
#
# While `iwd` is a modern and promising replacement for `wpa_supplicant`, and
# `connman` is designed to be lightweight, this combination has exhibited the
# following issues in practice:
#
# - **`iwd`:** Still considered experimental by some distributions, it can fail
#   to auto-connect after suspend/hibernate, requiring manual restarts of the
#   service.
#
# - **`connman`:** Can be less intuitive for managing complex network setups
#   and has shown inconsistencies with tethered connections.
#
# - **`unbound`:** A powerful recursive resolver, but its strictness can lead
#   to resolution failures in public Wi-Fi or captive portal scenarios.
#
# For these reasons, the current configuration remains the recommended and
# default choice for this machine.

    # DNS-over-TLS (DoT) Configuration:
    # DoT encrypts DNS queries, enhancing privacy by preventing eavesdropping.
    # The `dnsovertls` option is set to "true", which enables opportunistic mode.
    #
    # In opportunistic mode, `systemd-resolved` attempts to use DoT. However,
    # if the server doesn't support it, or if an active attacker on the network
    # blocks the DoT connection (port 853), it will fall back to standard,
    # unencrypted DNS (port 53).
    #
    # This mode is vulnerable to active downgrade attacks.
    # It is chosen to prioritize reliability and compatibility across different
    # networks over strict security. It protects against passive eavesdropping,
    # but not an active man-in-the-middle attacker.
    #
    # A stricter setup would involve exclusively defining DoT-enabled servers in
    # `extraConfig` and potentially using firewall rules to block outgoing
    # unencrypted DNS traffic, but this can lead to connection failures on
    # restrictive networks.
    dnsovertls = "true";

    # DNSSEC Validation:
    # DNSSEC cryptographically verifies that DNS responses are authentic. However,
    # many DNS servers in the wild are misconfigured and cause validation to fail,
    # which can make domains unreachable and break the user experience.
    # For this reason, systemd developers recommend caution.
    # The available options are:
    # - "false" (default): Disables validation. Maximizes compatibility.
    # - "true": Enforces strict validation. Most secure, but may break browsing.
    # - "allow-downgrade": A pragmatic compromise. It attempts validation but
    #   falls back to an insecure lookup if the server appears to be broken.
    # It is currently disabled to prioritize reliability over strict validation.
    # dnssec = "true";

    # Fallback DNS Configuration:
    # While it is possible to force specific DNS servers using `extraConfig`,
    # this can lead to network instability. For example, a mismatch between
    # a globally forced DNS (e.g., 1.1.1.1) and a network-provided DNS
    # (e.g., 8.8.8.8 from a Wi-Fi network) can cause resolution failures,
    # requiring a manual restart of the `systemd-resolved` service.
    #
    # To avoid this, we rely on the default `FallbackDNS` servers built into
    # `systemd-resolved`. This provides a reliable "just works" experience.
    # When `dnsovertls` is enabled, `systemd-resolved` automatically attempts
    # to use DNS-over-TLS with these fallback servers. It gracefully manages
    # connections by using DoT when available and falling back to standard DNS
    # when not, ensuring a balance of security and reliability. This approach,
    # combined with respecting DNS servers from the local network, ensures
    # seamless connectivity across different network environments.
    #
    # By default, systemd-resolved uses Cloudflare, Google, Quad9 and DNS0 Public DNS servers.
    # For more details, see: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/docs/DISTRO_PORTING.md
    #
    # The following `extraConfig` examples are commented out to prevent DNS conflicts.
    # If you need to enforce a specific set of servers, uncomment one of them,
    # but be aware of the potential for network issues as described above.
    #
    # The first format provides a space-separated list of IP addresses.
