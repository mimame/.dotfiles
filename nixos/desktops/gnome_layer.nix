# This module provides a GNOME compatibility layer for non-GNOME window managers
# like Niri or Sway. It enables essential GNOME services and features that are
# often required for a complete and functional desktop experience, even when not
# running the full GNOME Shell.
#
# This includes:
# - GDM (GNOME Display Manager) for login management.
# - GNOME Keyring for secure credential storage.
# - PolicyKit for graphical privilege escalation.
# - GVFS for virtual file system access (e.g., trash, network shares).
# - DConf for application settings and theming.
# - Core GNOME applications and utilities.
#
# By enabling these services, this module ensures that both GNOME-native and
# third-party applications integrate smoothly and function as expected.

  # ensuring that the correct theme is applied at login. It requires the
