# Ghostty Configuration File

# This file configures the behavior and appearance of Ghostty
# For a comprehensive list of options and their descriptions,
# refer to the official documentation:
# https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference

# Copy on Select: Enables copying selected text to the clipboard by hovering the mouse over the selection
# Options:
#   - "clipboard": Copies the selected text to the clipboard and system clipboard
copy-on-select = clipboard

# Disable specific app-notifications
app-notifications = no-clipboard-copy

# Font Family: Specifies the font used in the terminal
# List available fonts with `ghostty +list-fonts`
# Multiple fonts can be specified as a fallback in case the first font is not available
font-family = "JetBrainsMonoNL Nerd Font Mono"

# Font Size: Sets the font size in points
font-size = 18.0

# Minimum Contrast: Defines the minimum contrast ratio between foreground and background colors
# This setting helps ensure readability and accessibility, adhering to WCAG 2.0 guidelines
# Range: 1 (no contrast, e.g., black on black) to 21 (maximum contrast, e.g., black on white)
# Recommended values:
#   - 1.1: Prevents invisible text (text color identical to the background)
#   - 3.0 or higher: Ensures readable text.  This is a good starting point
#   - Higher values: Increase the likelihood of text becoming pure black or white to meet the contrast requirement,
#                    which might not be aesthetically pleasing
minimum-contrast = 3

# Enables Ghostty's shell integration features.
# To disable a feature, use the "no-" prefix.
#
# Available features:
#   - cursor: Blinking bar cursor at the prompt.
#   - sudo: Sudo wrapper to preserve terminfo.
#   - title: Updates the window title via shell integration.
#   - ssh-env: Enable SSH environment variable compatibility. Automatically converts
#     TERM from xterm-ghostty to xterm-256color when connecting to remote hosts and
#     propagates COLORTERM, TERM_PROGRAM, and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION.
#   - ssh-terminfo: Enable automatic terminfo installation on remote hosts. Attempts
#     to install Ghostty's terminfo entry using infocmp and tic when connecting to
#     hosts that lack it.
#
# SSH features work independently and can be combined for optimal experience:
# when both ssh-env and ssh-terminfo are enabled, Ghostty will install its
# terminfo on remote hosts and use xterm-ghostty as TERM, falling back to
# xterm-256color with environment variables if terminfo installation fails.
shell-integration-features = cursor,no-sudo,title,ssh-env,ssh-terminfo

# Theme: Sets the color theme for the terminal
# List available themes with `ghostty +list-themes`
theme = Dracula

# Hides the mouse cursor when typing in the terminal.
