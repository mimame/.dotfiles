# Range: 1 (no contrast, e.g., black on black) to 21 (maximum contrast, e.g., black on white)

#   - 1.1: Prevents invisible text (text color identical to the background)
#   - 3.0 or higher: Ensures readable text.  This is a good starting point

#                    which might not be aesthetically pleasing
